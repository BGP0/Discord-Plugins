# Discord-Plugins
My discord plugins, currently just for the developer experiments plugin
Its not on the official site because they consider it self bot or api spam when all my plugin does is delete messages every 1.5s lol.

Recently the devs have removed the updater from zeres lib without warning but luckily because of people like me complaining they re-enabled it temporarily. But because it is only temporary I have written my own custom updater which will now be used. However this may break in the future if they decide to remove file system functionality or something. So if any of my plugins are broken, check if there is an update available on github and copy the code manually.
